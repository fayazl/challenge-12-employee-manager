# challenge-12-employee-manager

## This is a command line interface application that allows users to input data into the database

## As a business owner I am tasked with adding new employees, adding new roles, updating roles and then viewing the updated tables

## We are using the inquirer, mysql2 and console.table packages to run this application


## NOTE: When using the CLI Inquirer, you must use the down or up arrow to get the next series of prompts after selecting an option.
